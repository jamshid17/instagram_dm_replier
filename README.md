# instagram_dm_replier
This little program uses python's browser automation library, Selenium, to access to your instagram account and check your DMs, likes if possible 
(see like_possibility function in ig_bot.py file). There are required libraries to install, and you need add .env file with a path to your browser (Firefox)
profile directory. Make sure that you are logged in instagram.com in this browser profile so that program automatically have access to your instagram 
profile. Originally, I linked this program to my personal telegram bot, so you can do maneuvers around it too. Have fun!
